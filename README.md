Misc Visual Studio Odds and Ends

The Boilerplate directory contains a Boilerplate AddIn that inserts boilerplate code into blank source files (C++ header and implementation).
This is a very rough project and code, mostly a learning exercise and totally unclean.

The Code Snippets directory contains some simple snippets adapted from the ones supplied with Visual Studio.
